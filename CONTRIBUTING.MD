# Contributing

## Workflow

1. Search through the issues to see if your particular issue has already been discovered and possibly addressed
2. Open an issue if you can't find anything helpful
3. Open a PR for proposed changes

## Commit Guidelines

I have chosen to loosely follow the [Angular Commit Guidelines](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit)
