# JSON API .Net Core

A framework for building [json:api](http://jsonapi.org/) compliant web servers. It allows you to eliminate a significant amount of boilerplate while offering out-of-the-box features such as sorting, filtering and pagination. This library provides all the required middleware to build a complete server. All you need to focus on is defining the resources and implementing your custom business logic. This library has been designed around dependency injection making extensibility incredibly easy.
