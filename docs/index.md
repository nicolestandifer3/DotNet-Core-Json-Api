# JSON API .Net Core

A [{ json:api }](https://jsonapi.org) web application framework for .Net Core.

## Objectives

### 1. Eliminate Boilerplate

The goal of this package is to facility the development of json:api applications that leverage the full range 
of features provided by the specification.

Eliminate CRUD boilerplate and provide the following features across all your resource endpoints: 

- Relationship inclusion and navigation
- Filtering
- Sorting
- Pagination
- Sparse field selection
- Checkout the [example requests](request-examples) to see the kind of features you will get out of the box

### 2. Extensibility

This library relies heavily on an open-generic-based dependency injection model which allows for easy per-resource customization.
